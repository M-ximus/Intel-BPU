# Intel-BPU
It's a small research to understanding how different algorithms work. I used RISC-V simulator (by ILab) to collet statistics about misses and hits. Each type of tests has detail table about 6 algothims of BPU - always taken, always not taken, backward jumps, saturating one bit, saturating two bits and advanced two levels. And in comments I tried to explain results of each test.
